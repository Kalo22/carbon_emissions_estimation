As a part of my final year Bachelors project I looked at the carbon footprit produced by the aviaiton industry within Europe

This is a script, that fetches data from ADS-B receivers though API calls, employs feature engineering, by combining external features and performing mathematical calculations in order to get fuel consumption and Co2 emissions of all intra-European Flights for a given period of time (as long as you leave the script running)
csv files are too large to upload
Instructions 
1.Leave the Live_Data_fetch file running for as long as you like (a document with all current flights that are on the ground will appear)
2.Completed flights will be saved in an intermediate .csv file
3. Move the completed_flighs.cvs file in the other folders and run the scripts one by one
4. The final deliverable will be a .csv file containing all of the features of the detected flights. The information will be ready to analyse
